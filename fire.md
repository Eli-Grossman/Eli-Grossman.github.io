## Yosemite
I am currently work as a GS-5 fire effects monitor crewmember on Yosemite Crew 9. Under the supervision of the park fire ecologist, we are a five person team responsible for accomplishing the objectives of our park's fire ecology monitoring program. First year on the crew, I finished my "Fire Effects Monitor" red card qualification.

You can see a sample of our work last year here that I did the data analysis and visualization for:

## Cibola National Forest
I spent two abbreviated fire seasons as a crewmember on the Apache Kid Wilderness Wildland Fire Module based out of the Magdalena Ranger District, Cibola National Forest. Beyond developing my basic wildland firefighting skills, I began training as a fire effects monitor to provide real-time incident fire behavior and effects observations on large managed fires.

Here's a sample FEMO report I helped write on a training assignment:

# Elk Gut Microbiomes

<Insert Image from Thesis, Insert Image from Elk Migration>

My undergraduate thesis work in Tyler Kartzinel's laboratory <LINK> examined how the gut microbiomes of Yellowstone's elk change as they migrate during the spring/summer season.

In collaboration with Dr. Bethan Littleford-Colquehoun, we showed that migratory elk have distinct microbiomes compared to those who choose a resident strategy. 

These microbial compositional differences might have important impacts on their hosts' physiological status, including feed efficiency, plant toxin resistance, and vitamin production. We therefore suggest the gut microbiome might play an important role in enabling elk migratory behavior.

We also show that a neutral model of community assembly does a decent job of explaining our observed microbial species abudance/occurrence frequency relationships and that metabolic functions associated with taxa deviating from the neutral model expectations are linked to species-species interactions that violate neutral expectations, such as cross-feeding and complex carbohydrate degradation.

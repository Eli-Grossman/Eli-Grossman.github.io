#Elk Gut Microbiomes

<Insert Image from Thesis, Insert Image from Elk Migration>

My undergraduate thesis work in Tyler Kartzinel's laboratory <LINK> examined how the gut microbiomes of Yellowstone's elk change as they migrate during the spring/summer season.

In collaboration with Dr. Bethan Littleford-Colquehoun, we showed that migratory elk have distinct microbiomes compared to those who choose a resident strategy.

These compositional differences might have important impacts on the host physiological status, including feed efficiency, plant toxin resistance, and vitamin production.
